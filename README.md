# IPA Lookup - Search for Pronuncations in Different Languages

Finding IPA pronunciations, even for large and otherwise well-supported languages, can be difficult and at times inconsistent. The tools below allow you to look up words and phrases in different languages and get transcription in IPA (and sometimes audio!).

The data comes from the [ipa-dict](https://github.com/open-dict-data/ipa-dict) project. If you would like to add a language that you don't see here, or make a correction, check out the [project page on GitHub](https://github.com/open-dict-data/ipa-dict)!
